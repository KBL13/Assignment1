    First version of the RoleGame prototype
    
    This first version includes de Weapon abstract class, the WeaponsFactory
    and one of the necessary implementations (CommonSword).
    
    Comments are missing. Working on that now.

I tried using git diff .gitignored but it returned nothing.

D. I tried using git diff --stat to show the IDs of the commits used to merge the changes but terminal
but at this point I'm starting to suspect I was supposed to do all my commits and pushes in development
to be merged later onto master.

E. Two reasons for using branches in a Git repository is to support quality assurance/code quality/
integration/testing proesses and to isolate developement activities among the team (branches for new features 
vs branches for bug fixes).

F. The difference is git log gets info about last commits and git status show the working tree status.

G. The command to see commits where "Weapon.h" was one of the commited files would be git log --follow Weapon.h

H. The command one woul use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word "file" would be
git log --grep="file"

I. Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object using the same implementation. 
Polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on 
their data type or class. Encapsulation is where a language construct that facilitates the bundling of data
with the methods operating on that data.
